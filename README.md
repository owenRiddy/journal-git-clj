# journal-git-clj

This is a script I developed to help me keep a journal when I write code.

A typical invocation in source form might be:

```
lein run --exclude-commits doc/commits.exclude --journal doc/real.journal >journaling-clojure.md
```

Alternatively, sometimes I build an uberjar (`lein uberjar`), rename it and run it with:

```
java -jar journal-git-clj.jar --exclude-commits doc/commits.exclude --journal doc/real.journal >journaling-clojure.md
```
